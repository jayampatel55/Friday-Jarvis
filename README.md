# Friday-Jarvis
Voice controlled "AI" with built in basic functions like:
1. Open/close spotify or any other applications.
2. Searches Wikipedia
3. Searches google
4. Checks weather forecast, etc.....

It uses basic python language without any frontend design, planning to add a proper frontend to it in some time, will update it here!

#Need of this project
There are a lot of voice assistants 100 times better than this, but this project aims at the specific and to point the need for personal requirments. Its nothing more than a basic if-else ladder, you can easily customize and change the code according your own need, it only responds after user speaks "hello Friday".
